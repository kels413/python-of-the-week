OS MODULE.


Python OS Module Functions
Here we will discuss some important functions of the Python os module :

Handling the Current Working Directory
Creating a Directory
Listing out Files and Directories with Python
Deleting Directory or Files using Python

OS MODULE In python provides function we use to communicates with the operating system

CWD = current working directory
Method = os.getcwd()
let's talk bout the current working directory of python.

python consider current working diretory as the place it is operating on. whenever we do python3 <name of our file>, python assumes that the file is in the same directory, else the file is not in the same directory we have to pass the full path of the file to the python interpreter.

The parameter is needed in the method.

Exception:
OSError


example:

cwd = os.getcwd()
print(cwd)

output:
/Users/mistarkelly/ubuntu_shared/My-Projects/python-of-the-week/Lecture


##CHANGE Directories

Method == os.chdir()


this helps us to change the current working directory of the python script

example
def check_directory():
    print("path before changing the directory")
    cwd = os.getcwd()
    

check_directory()
os.chdir(../)
print(os.getcwd)

Output:
/Users/mistarkelly/ubuntu_shared/My-Projects/python-of-the-week/Lecture
path before changing the directory
/Users/mistarkelly/ubuntu_shared/My-Projects/python-of-the-week
